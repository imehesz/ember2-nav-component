ember2-nav-component
====================

This is just a simple example on how to create and use a component with the Ember2 JS framework.

**old-school** is using Ember's starter-kit (which is pretty much deprecated)

**new-school** is using [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) with ES6 goodness.
